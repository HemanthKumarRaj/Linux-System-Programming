=>>> Working with multiple file in Vim

This is very useful when we working with multiple file. For example, if you are coding in a file and at the same time you need another file for reference, so general technique is to use another terminal or open new window. But Vim have another nice option, by which you can split current working window in two sections and work on both file at the same time. 

Split window vertically or horizontally

In Normal mode, use command

:vs filename         ———Split window vertically

:sp filename         ———Split window horizontally

Note:- use Ctrl+w to shuffle between two opened section in Normal mode.
